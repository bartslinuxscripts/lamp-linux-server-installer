lamp-linux-server-installer is a simple and effective way to deploy
a LAMP Stack on your Linux machine. Just download the script, run
it and you're good to go :)

It automatically detects if your Linux box runs a 32/64-bit OS and
whether it's running Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or CentOS.

 - Requirements:

   wget installed if you don't have root privileges.

   Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS installed on your server.

- How to run:

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartslinuxscripts/lamp-linux-server-installer/master/installer --no-check-certificate

  chmod +x installer

  ./installer
